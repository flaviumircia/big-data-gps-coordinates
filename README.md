### Build the project

This ensures complete reproducibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1. Build and start the container: ```docker-compose up --build```

2. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8888

3. Select the ```Python (gps-analytics)``` kernel in Jupyter Lab.

Your notebooks and source code are automatically synced thanks to mounted volumes.

Jupyter Lab is running inside the container, with PySpark and all dependencies pre-installed.
